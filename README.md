# 🐾 PupToken Whitepaper

### Version 1.0 | Community Edition

## 📖 Abstract

PupToken (PUP) is a decentralized, community-driven cryptocurrency built on the **Scrypt Proof-of-Work** algorithm. It was created to promote fairness, transparency, and fun within the crypto mining ecosystem. PupToken is designed for everyone — from solo miners to large pools — to participate equally, with no premine and no central authority.

The mission of PupToken is simple: **to bring back honest mining and community spirit to blockchain**. Each block mined strengthens a transparent ecosystem powered by the collective will of its holders.

## 💎 Vision

PupToken aims to restore the original decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency: a fair, open network where participation is earned, not pre-allocated. Our goal is to create a sustainable and engaging ecosystem where miners, traders, and holders work together to grow the network organically.

> **"By the community, for the community — forever decentralized."**

## 🌍 Core Principles

1. **Fairness** – No premine, no insider advantages. Everyone starts equally.
2. **Transparency** – Open-source code, public explorer, and verifiable builds.
3. **Community First** – Driven by miners, not corporations.
4. **Decentralization** – Fully distributed, with no central control or authority.

## 🧱 Blockchain Overview

PupToken’s blockchain operates on the proven **Scrypt PoW algorithm**, known for its energy efficiency and ASIC-resistance compared to older proof-of-work systems. Each block generates 500 PUP coins, with halvings occurring every 500,000 blocks to ensure long-term scarcity.

Transaction validation is community-based, and blocks require six confirmations to ensure network integrity. This lightweight yet robust structure ensures fast, secure, and reliable transactions.
